        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>Press Committee Photographer and Writer</h3>
        <h4>WMUC Radio</h4>
        <h5>December 2023 - Present</h5>
        <p>
            I take photos and write about concerts in the DMV area and beyond
            for UMD’s campus radio station’s blog. So far, I have interviewed
            the band Couch regarding their newest EP.
        </p>

        <h3>Photo contributor, writer</h3>
        <h4>DC Music Review</h4>
        <h5>November 2023 - Present</h5>
        <p>
            As a freelancer for DC Music Review, I photograph and write about
            concerts in the DMV area. I communicate with bands’ PR teams and
            venues to acquire press passes to live shows. I usually take photos
            and write reviews of the concerts I attend, and I occasionally
            interview the artists before or after the show for promotions of
            their concerts and music.
        </p>

        <h3>Photo Intern</h3>
        <h4>
            University of Maryland Office of Marketing and Communications
            Internship
        </h4>
        <h5>October 2023 - Present</h5>
        <p>
            I photograph campus events for UMD’s official social media and
            publications, including Maryland Today, Terp Magazine, and others. I
            also take photos for different university departments, including
            University Relations or the Office of the President. I use Photo
            Mechanic to incorporate metadata and practice organization of photos
            for our archives as well as do research on the university.
            Additionally, I learn and practice editing techniques using a
            variety of software, including Photoshop Lightroom, and Lightroom
            Classic.
        </p>

        <h3>Reporter/Photographer</h3>
        <h4>Terrapin Yearbook</h4>
        <h5>November 2022 - Present</h5>
        <p>
            I photograph campus events weekly and capture sports. I write
            captions for photos and sections within the yearbook, and I write
            brief descriptions of major news events–both local and global–that
            occurred during the school year.
        </p>

        <h3>Staff Photographer and Freelance Writer</h3>
        <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
        <h5>August 2022 - September 2023</h5>
        <p>
            I photographed and documented local and campus events and sports for
            the university’s oldest student newspaper. My photographs appeared
            in 68 articles in news, sports, and diversions sections.
            Additionally, I wrote six articles published in varying styles and
            sections, including two celebrity interviews.
        </p>

        <h3>Photographer, Guest Writer</h3>
        <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>
        <h5>August 2022 - December 2022</h5>
        <p>
            I photographed campus events for this online student publication and
            wrote two articles while on the staff. I still freelance for them as
            well, typically contributing photo stories about events that receive
            little coverage.
        </p>

        <h3>Anchor, producer, and videographer</h3>
        <h4>NATV</h4>
        <h5>2021 - 2022</h5>
        <p>
            In high school, I anchored, contributed to the production team, and
            produced video packages for North Allegheny Senior High School’s
            morning announcements and accompanying news outlet, "The NASH
            Uproar."
        </p>

        <h3>Photography Editor and Staff writer</h3>
        <h4>NASH Uproar</h4>
        <h5>2020-2022</h5>
        <p>
            I photographed school events for North Allegheny Senior High
            School’s online newspaper, compiling 105 photo credits. I wrote and
            produced 64 articles and videos. We were the second high school in
            the country to achieve SNO (Student Newspapers Online) Distinguished
            Site status in the 2021-2022 school year; five personal Best of SNO
            Awards. I was also the paper’s first ever Junior Photography Editor
            in my junior year, before completing my high school education as the
            Senior Photography Editor and Senior Staff Writer.
        </p>

        <h3>Press Corps Journalism Correspondent</h3>
        <h4>The Shofar</h4>
        <h5>2020 - 2022</h5>
        <p>
            I wrote and produced 12 articles and videos for the international
            Jewish youth organization BBYO’s international newsletter. I was
            also a photographer and videographer for BBYO’s International
            Convention in 2021 (virtual) and 2022 in Baltimore, Maryland. I
            interviewed Rabbi Angela Buchdal on camera for BBYO Insider’s
            YouTube livestream of the convention in Baltimore.
