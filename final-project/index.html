                        Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the world has
                        experienced profound ecological changes. Wildlife
                        populations have decreased by 69 percent, the result of
                        habitat loss caused by rapid industrialization and
                        changing temperatures. 2023 was the hottest year on
                        record.

                        Certain ancient practices could mitigate the deleterious
                        effects of global warming. From building seaside gardens
                        to water management in desert terrain, these
                        time-honored practices work with the natural worldâ€™s
                        rhythms. Some might even hold the key to a more
                        resilient future and a means of building security for
                        both Indigenous communities and other groups
                        disproportionately impacted by climate change.
