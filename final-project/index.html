                        Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the world has
                        experienced profound ecological changes. Wildlife
                        populations have decreased by 69 percent, the result of
                        habitat loss caused by rapid industrialization and
                        changing temperatures. 2023 was the hottest year on
                        record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain ancient practices could mitigate the deleterious
                        effects of global warming. From building seaside gardens
                        to water management in desert terrain, these
                        time-honored practices work with the natural world’s
                        rhythms. Some might even hold the key to a more
                        resilient future and a means of building security for
                        both Indigenous communities and other groups
                        disproportionately impacted by climate change.

                    <h2>Zuni waffle gardens</h2>

                    <p>
                        Jim Enote, 66, has been planting a traditional Zuni
                        waffle garden (or hek’ko:we in the Zuni language) since
                        before he could walk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “My grandma said I started planting when I was an infant
                        tied to a cradleboard,” said Enote, who grew up on the
                        water-scarce Zuni Pueblo on the southeastern edge of the
                        Colorado plateau. “She put seeds in my baby hands, and I
                        dropped seeds into a hole.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enote has continued this ancient garden design, creating
                        rows of sunken squares surrounded by adobe walls that
                        catch and hold water like pools of syrup in a massive
                        earthen waffle. The sustainable design protects crops
                        from wind, reduces erosion and conserves water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Water is scarce here and becoming more so every year,”
                        said Enote, referring to the increasing drought and heat
                        caused by climate change. “So, I continue planting
                        waffle gardens.”

                    <h2>‘Good fire’</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before European settlers traveled to the American West,
                        Indigenous people managed the landscape of northern
                        California with “cultural burns” to improve soil
                        quality, spur the growth of particular plants, and
                        create a “healthy and resilient landscape,” according to
                        the National Park Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The Karuk have developed a relationship with fire over
                        the millennia to maintain and steward a balanced
                        ecosystem,” said Bill Tripp, director of natural
                        resources and environmental policy for the Karuk Tribe.
                        “A good portion of the resources that we depend on, in
                        the natural environment, are dependent on fire.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But in the mid-19th century, Indigenous burning was
                        outlawed. Not only did that cause the Karuk to lose a
                        vital part of their culture, but also, it invited
                        potentially worse wildfires. The burns had reduced the
                        amount of fuel accidental fires feed on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “They [forestry agencies] suppressed fire for so long
                        we’re experiencing these massive burns,” said Tripp. A
                        2023 study published by the Proceedings of the National
                        Academy of Sciences found that 10 of the largest
                        wildfires in California’s history occurred in the last
                        20 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “And, of course, they’re [fires] being exacerbated by
                        climate change,” he said.

                        Prescribed burning has returned as state and federal
                        agencies recognize the importance of fire in managing
                        forests. In 2022, California passed legislation
                        affirming the right to cultural fire and is considering
                        another bill (backed by the Karuk Tribe) to reduce the
                        barriers to cultural burns on tribal lands.

                    <p>
                        According to the Karuk Tribe, “Passage of this bill
                        would be an act of cultural and environmental justice.”

                    <h2>Ancient irrigation</h2>
                    <p>
                        In New Mexico, there are 700 functioning acequias,
                        centuries-old community irrigation systems that have
                        helped the parched state build water resilience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These acequias — a design from North African, Spanish
                        and Indigenous traditions — were established during the
                        1600s. The name can refer to both the gravity-fed
                        ditches filled with water and the farmers who
                        collectively manage water. Unlike large-scale irrigation
                        systems, water seepage from unlined acequias helps
                        replenish the water table and reduce aridification by
                        adding water to the landscape. The earthen ditches mimic
                        seasonal streams and expand riparian habitats for
                        numerous native species.

                        “For one, it’s a very good and sustainable system to
                        take water from one source and put it into the
                        community,” said Jorge Garcia, executive director of the
                        Center for Social Sustainable Systems and secretary of
                        the South Valley Regional Association of Acequias.
                        “Without acequias, none of those ecosystems would exist
                        in the way we know them today.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “We need to maintain those knowledge systems, especially
                        if we continue through dry years,” said Garcia. “We're
                        going to need all of that to survive.”

                    <h2>The original carbon capture technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        U.S. forests are carbon sinks, sequestering up to 10
                        percent of nationwide CO2 emissions. Indigenous forestry
                        can play a critical role in reducing global warming by
                        restoring biodiversity and health to these ecosystems,
                        including the management of culturally significant
                        plants, animals and fungi that contribute to healthier
                        soil.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “We know that most of the carbon in the forest is stored
                        in the soil, and healthy soil depends on diversity,”
                        said Stephanie Gutierrez, a member of the San Carlos
                        Apache Tribe and the forests and community program
                        director for Ecotrust. “So, when forests are managed for
                        a diversity of species or purpose and management
                        outcomes, this will lead to better climate outcomes as
                        well.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet tribal forestry remains severely underfunded and
                        underutilized on public lands. Indigenous Hawaiians are
                        reintroducing ancient food forests once destroyed by
                        overgrazing, logging and commercial agriculture. These
                        biodiverse edible forests increase food security and
                        build nutrient-dense soils that sequester carbon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Just think about that potential if we implemented
                        tribal forestry practices on [not just] tribally owned
                        lands. Adjacent landowners, community forests, national
                        and state forests and parks should also work with tribes
                        to incorporate their techniques,” Gutierrez said.

                    <p>
                        The Hopi nation in Arizona receives an average of 10
                        inches of rain per year — a third of what crop
                        scientists say is necessary to grow corn successfully.
                        Yet Hopi farmers have been cultivating corn and other
                        traditional crops without irrigation for millennia,
                        relying on traditional ecological knowledge rooted in
                        life in the high desert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I like to call traditional ecological knowledge the
                        things my grandfather taught me,” said Michael Kotutwa
                        Johnson, a Hopi dryland farmer and academic. Hopi
                        farming practices include passive rainwater harvesting,
                        myriad techniques to retain soil moisture, and a
                        reliance on traditional seed varieties superbly adapted
                        to the desert.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “The fact we are able to raise crops such as maize with
                        only 6 to 10 inches of precipitation as opposed to the
                        standard 33 inches of precipitation is outstanding,”
                        Johnson said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As climate change drives increased drought and heat in
                        the region, Johnson looks to the knowledge and practices

                        extremes. “Our agriculture is integrated into our
                        cultural belief system that has sustained us for
                        millennia,” he said.

                    <h2>Restoring salmon runs</h2>
                    <p>
                        In recent decades, an Indigenous-led plan has begun to
                        restore salmon runs on the Klamath River.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The salmon began to disappear in 1918 when the first of
                        five dams blocked the path of the Chinook salmon as they
                        made their way upstream to spawn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “The river was cut in half,” said the Yurok Fisheries
                        Department Director Barry McCovey Jr. of the devastating
                        impact the dam had on the salmon runs that Indigenous
                        people depended on. Chinook salmon populations on the
                        Klamath River have since declined by an estimated 90
                        percent due to habitat loss, poor water quality and
                        climate change.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “We’re seeing the system slowly heat up,” said McCovey,
                        explaining that elevated water temperatures can lead to
                        increased disease and toxic algae blooms. “You layer
                        climate change on top [of habitat loss], and it’s not
                        good news for salmon or anything that relies on a
                        healthy river.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After removing the dams and implementing a massive river
                        restoration, the salmon are returning. “The river, in
                        its natural state, had that climate change resiliency
                        built into it,” McCovey said.

                    <p>
                        Seventy-five percent of global crop diversity has been
                        lost in the past century, further threatening food
                        security as agriculture becomes increasingly vulnerable
                        to climate change.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Our oral histories and the historical record show
                        extreme droughts,” said Aaron Lowden, a seed keeper and
                        traditional farmer from the Acoma Pueblo, a village west
                        of Albuquerque. “This isn’t the first time they’ve
                        [seeds] been stressed out.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As former program director for Ancestral Lands and now
                        Indigenous Seedkeepers Network program coordinator at
                        the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, Lowden
                        has successfully returned dozens of varieties of
                        traditional arid-adapted seeds such as Acoma blue corn,
                        Acoma pumpkin, Acoma melon and other crops to his
                        pueblo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For Lowden, building this biodiversity is both a
                        response to climate change and a step in restoring the
                        health and sovereignty of the Acoma people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Our people were systemically removed from these
                        lifestyle ways and practices,” said Lowden, who has seen
                        disproportionately higher rates of hunger, diet-related
                        disease and food insecurity in tribal communities. “For
                        me, it’s been trying to dismantle all of that.”

                    <h2>Swinomish clam gardens</h2>
                    <p>
                        When Swinomish fisherman Joe Williams walked onto the
                        shore of Skagit Bay in Washington to help build the
                        first modern clam garden in the United States, he was
                        overwhelmed with a sense of the past and present
                        colliding. “It was magic, really,” said Williams, who
                        also serves as the community liaison for the Swinomish
                        tribe. “I could feel the presence of my ancestors.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For thousands of years, the Swinomish built and
                        maintained clam gardens on the coasts of the Pacific
                        Northwest. They constructed rock terraces in low-tide
                        lines to increase shellfish production. The gardens also
                        help the clams weather the impacts of a changing climate
                        by moderating water temperature and expanding habitat
                        threatened by rising seas and ocean acidification.

                    <p>
                        “That was how [ancestors] provided food for their
                        communities, tending these gardens, living through
                        climate change from then to now,” Williams said.

                    <p>
                        “We are rediscovering this way of life that sustained
                        our people through past natural climate change events,”
                        he said. “We can utilize the playbook that our ancestors
                        left us in terms of adapting to a fast-changing
                        environment.”

                    <h2>Climate-smart Indigenous design</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the field of architecture, Indigenous knowledge and
                        technologies have long been overlooked. Julia Watson’s
                        book “Lo—TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism,” published
                        in 2019, examines Indigenous land management practices
                        that represent a catalogue of sustainable, adaptable and
                        resilient design, from living bridges able to withstand
                        monsoons in northern India to man-made underground
                        streams, called qanats, in what is now Iran.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Gatekeeping how we technologically innovate for climate
                        resilience by the West can really limit us,” Watson
                        said. “We’re looking for solutions that can adapt to
                        climate extremes and huge fluctuations. These Indigenous
                        technologies evolved from those conditions, molded by
                        huge fluctuations, extreme fire events, water and food
                        scarcity, and flood events.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some of the techniques and solutions work with nature
                        instead of attempting to conquer it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “[Indigenous technologies] are really intelligent and
                        capture the DNA of the ecosystem and communities,”
                        Watson said. “What’s incredibly sophisticated is a
                        technology shaped by man and nature working together.”
